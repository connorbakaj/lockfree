A **lock-free**, **single-producer single-consumer** queue written in modern **C++23**.  
Designed for **ultra-low-latency** message passing in high-performance and real-time systems.

| Operation         | Median Latency (ns) | Notes                         |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Enqueue (push)    | **5**               | âœ… **Lock-free SPSC**         |
| Dequeue (pop)     | **5**               | âœ… **Lock-free SPSC**         |
| Enqueue (push)    | 73                  | Mutex-based SPSC              |
| Dequeue (pop)     | 80                  | Mutex-based SPSC              |
| Enqueue (push)    | 102                 | Condition variable-based SPSC |
| Dequeue (pop)     | 102                 | Condition variable-based SPSC |

## âœ¨ Features
- **Lock-free** design â€” no mutexes, no blocking
- **Single-producer / single-consumer** optimized
- **Wait-free push/pop** operations (bounded)
- **Cache-line padding** to avoid false sharing
- **Memory-ordering correctness** with `std::memory_order_acquire` / `std::memory_order_release`
- **C++23 Concepts** to enforce type safety
- **Header-only** for easy integration
